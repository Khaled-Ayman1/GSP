## Introduction

The GSP algorithm stands for Generalized Sequential Pattern algorithm, which is utilized for discovering frequently occurring patterns in sequence databases. It's particularly useful in various domains such as market basket analysis, web usage mining, DNA sequence analysis, and more.

This Python implementation of the GSP algorithm provides a simple and efficient way to identify patterns within sequential data, enabling users to extract valuable insights from ordered datasets.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Khaled-Ayman1/GSP.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
